# YOLOv5 QR Code Extraction Model for Finch Disease Tracking

## Introduction

This repository contains the YOLOv5-based QR Code Extraction Model developed for a research project focused on tracking disease in finches. The model uses state-of-the-art computer vision techniques to detect and extract QR codes attached to finches' backs during their interactions.

## Project Overview

In this research project, QR codes are attached to the backs of finches to enable automated tracking of their interactions. The YOLOv5 model is employed to locate and extract QR codes from images and videos, facilitating the collection of valuable data for disease tracking. The extracted QR codes can be used to identify individual finches and log their interactions over time.
